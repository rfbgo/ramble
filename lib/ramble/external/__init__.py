"""This module contains the following external, potentially separately
licensed, packages that are included in Spack:

ruamel.yaml
------

* Homepage: https://yaml.readthedocs.io/
* Usage: Used for config files. Ruamel is based on PyYAML but is more
  actively maintained and has more features, including round-tripping
  comments read from config files.
* Version: 0.11.15 (last version supporting Python 2.6)
* Note: This package has been slightly modified to improve Python 2.6
  compatibility -- some ``{}`` format strings were replaced, and the
  import for ``OrderedDict`` was tweaked.
